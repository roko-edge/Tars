# Architecture

**Audience:** TARS maintainers and engineering reviewers.

**Document type:** Current implementation record. Planned replacements belong in
specifications or proposals and are identified explicitly.

The repository contains one Rust package and one SystemVerilog prototype. They share
the Q8.24 numeric representation and the `npu/data/` artifact paths, but they do not yet
share a model topology format or an automated parity check.

## Rust model

`Module` defines the inference interface:

```rust
pub trait Module {
    fn forward(&self, input: &[f32]) -> Vec<f32>;
}
```

`AnyModule` provides runtime dispatch over the implemented module types:

```rust
pub enum AnyModule {
    Linear(Linear),
    Activation(Activation),
}
```

`Sequential` stores an ordered `Vec<AnyModule>`. Its builder methods update the
expected feature count when a linear layer is appended.

```rust
impl Sequential {
    pub fn new(input_size: usize) -> Self;
    pub fn linear(self, output_size: usize) -> Self;
    pub fn relu(self) -> Self;
    pub fn sigmoid(self) -> Self;
}
```

`Linear` stores weights as `Vec<Vec<f32>>`, indexed by output feature and then input
feature. Biases are stored as `Vec<f32>`. `Sequential::linear` constructs layers
through the zeros constructor; the random constructor is not used by the built-in
experiments.

```rust
impl Linear {
    pub fn new(
        in_sz: usize,
        out_sz: usize,
        weights: Vec<Vec<f32>>,
        bias: Vec<f32>,
    ) -> Self;
    pub fn zeros(in_sz: usize, out_sz: usize) -> Self;
    pub fn random(in_sz: usize, out_sz: usize) -> Self;
}
```

The remaining training interfaces are:

```rust
impl Data {
    pub fn new(input: &[f32], target: &[f32]) -> Self;
}

pub fn cost(model: &Sequential, data: &[Data]) -> f32;
pub fn num_grad(model: &Sequential, data: &[Data]) -> Grad;

impl BGD {
    pub fn new(lr: f32) -> Self;
    pub fn step(&self, model: &mut Sequential, grad: &Grad);
}
```

`cost` computes the mean squared error across output elements and samples.
`num_grad` computes centered finite differences with `h = 1e-3` for every weight and
bias. `BGD::step` applies the resulting gradient to each linear layer.

## Training executable

`src/bin/main.rs` performs the following operations:

1. Calls `experiments::or::train()` to construct the selected `Train` configuration.
2. Prints its `ExperimentType` identifier and initial MSE.
3. Trains with full-dataset analytical backpropagation and BGD, reporting progress.
4. Prints predictions for the configured dataset.
5. Exports Q8.24 model and dataset artifacts under `npu/`.
6. Builds a `NetGraph` from the trained model without saving or rendering it.

`Train` is defined in `src/train.rs` and re-exported as `tars::Train`. Experiment
factories provide the model, epochs, learning rate, dataset, and identifier. Selection
is fixed by the factory call in the executable source; there is no interactive
selector. Model and dataset export calls run after training.

See [`../EXPERIMENTS.md`](../EXPERIMENTS.md) for the configuration contract,
built-in experiments, reporting behavior, and manual extension workflow.

## Visualization

The visualization code is part of the `tars` package and is exported through
`tars::view`. `NetGraph` wraps `petgraph::graph::DiGraph<Perceptron, f32>` and exposes
the following interface:

```rust
impl NetGraph {
    pub fn new() -> Self;
    pub fn to_dot(&self) -> String;
    pub fn save_dot(&self, path: &str) -> std::io::Result<()>;
    pub fn add_node(&mut self, p: Perceptron);
    pub fn add_edge(&mut self, from: usize, to: usize, w: f32);
    pub fn plot(&self);
}
```

Node indices are retained in insertion order. `plot` invokes the external `dot`
command with fixed input and output paths. The visualization executable constructs
its own hard-coded `Sequential` model and is not connected to the model trained by
the main executable.

## SystemVerilog Hardware Subsystem

`npu/src/npu.sv` defines the top-level `npu` module, parameterized by vector length `N`:

```systemverilog
module npu #(
    parameter int IN  = 2,
    parameter int OUT = 2
) (
    input  logic               clk,
    input  logic               rst,
    input  logic               start,
    output logic               done,
    output logic signed [31:0] result[OUT]
);
```

The top-level NPU module uses a state machine (`IDLE`, `BUSY`) that sequences one output neuron at a time: for each output index `j`, it feeds `IN` input/weight pairs to the Processing Element (`pe.sv` in `npu/src/`), which maintains a 64-bit signed accumulator (`pe_acc`) operating on Q8.24 fixed-point words. After each output, the top level adds the per-output bias `b[j]` and saturates the sum to the signed 32-bit result range before committing it to `result[j]`. Internal memory arrays (`b[OUT]`, `w[IN*OUT]`, `a[IN]`) are populated via `$readmemh` from `data/` memory files.

`npu/tests/tb.sv` instantiates the DUT (`IN = 2`, `OUT = 1`), loads `data/bias.mem`, `data/weights.mem`, and `data/activations.mem`, executes four sequential evaluations with reset between them, logs trace outputs via `$dumpfile` / `$dumpvars`, and displays formatted Q8.24 results without automated assertions.

## Integration Boundary

The Rust export module (`src/export.rs`) converts floating-point weights, biases, inputs, and targets into Q8.24 fixed-point hexadecimal words (`to_q8_24` with truncation):

| Artifact File | Format | Source Generator | Consumer |
|---|---|---|---|
| `npu/data/weights.mem` | Q8.24 Hex | `export_model()` | `$readmemh` into `dut.w` |
| `npu/data/bias.mem` | Q8.24 Hex | `export_model()` | `$readmemh` into `dut.b` |
| `npu/data/activations.mem` | Q8.24 Hex | `export_data()` | `$readmemh` into the testbench data array |
| `npu/data/target.mem` | Q8.24 Hex | `export_data()` | Not loaded by the current testbench |

Export and simulation now operate on the same files: running the training binary
overwrites the checked-in memory files consumed by `make sim`. The shared encoding and
paths do not provide topology or activation information, `target.mem` holds dataset
labels rather than golden inference outputs, and the testbench performs no bit-exact
assertions. Topology compilation and golden-vector parity remain project targets
recorded in [`../project/ROADMAP.md`](../project/ROADMAP.md).
